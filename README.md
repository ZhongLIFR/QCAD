Paper submitted to DAMI

## Repo Structure

the QCAD repo includes two folders, Code and Data.

Specifcially, the Code folder contains the following sub-folders:

- Implementation: which includes the implementations of our contextual anomaly detection algorithm **QCAD**, and other SOTA contextual anomaly detection algorithms such as **COD**, **ROCOD**, **LoPAD**, and traditional anomaly detection algorithms **PyODtest**(based on PyOD);
- Utilities: which contains some utility function/scripts. **SynDataGen** that is used to generate synthetic datasets ; **ContextualAnomalyInject** that is used to inject contextual anomalies; **FindMB** (R) that is used to find Markov Blankets for the **LoPAD** algorithm;
- Examples: which contains the scripts used to generate examples in our paper. **ExampleFootball**
